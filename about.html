                    <p class="text-justify">We are a professional investment fund who specializes in investing in Forex, CFD’s, commodities and stocks. Our number one priority is to minimalize the high risk involved in investing. We have created different investment plans with different drawdowns, risk and trading instruments to meet our clients needs. We look for the best places to invest our clients assets in with low risk possibility. Some of them include trading based on fundimental reasons, mathematical probabilities, price action and other methods. Each of our professional trader has a different strategy, based on earlier mentioned methods. The traders, that we choose are all profitable. To ensure long term low levels of risk each trader is traded with different percentage of the investment portfolio, the more aggressive ones are traded with smaller positions and vice versa. We provide each of our client with a chance to personalize their own investment portfolio, however we have recommended guidelines avaliable in the “investment calculator” section. In our asset managing time, we have managed to gain profits to our clients on a monthly basis. Our statistics are avaliable on the website and they speak for themselves.</p>

            	 <h2 class="sec-pre-title">Why us</h2>
                
<p class="text-justify">As an example why you would want to invest in us, we would like to compare us with other forms of investing. Investing is needed, because, even if you don’t invest anywhere, your money still is eaten by inflation, which averages around 3% annually.</p>

<p class="text-justify">One may choose to invest in small businesses or create one themselves. However, it may not be such a good choice because it comes with hard work and on average 25% of small businesses fail within the first year,  50% within 4 years and 70% within 10 years. On average, small business growth is relatively close to the economy growth, which is around 3-5% year. 3-10% earnings per year are considered  stable earnings and more than 40% year  is unsustainable.  Most of the new businesses are unprofitable for the first years.</p>

<p class="text-justify">It may seem a good choice to invest in angel investing and venture capital investing which invest in start-ups with a large growth potential. On average angel investments gain 27% annually, however more than 50% of angel investments fail, the minimum investment is at least 10 000 $ and  to be profitable in angel investing one needs 6 or more investments to diversify their portfolio, that accounts for a total sum of at least 60000$. In these investments first years are usually unprofitable.</p>

<p class="text-justify">Our estimated profits are 40-60%  with 20% risk annually, profits from the first year,  less minimum investments and we already have a diversified portfolio. Even if one chooses to invest in angel investing or venture capital, our fund can be a great addition to your portfolio, because our profits are generated from trading, not investing. That means, that the risks and drawdowns are less likely to happen at the same time and will not be correlated with angel investing or venture capital investing.</p>
